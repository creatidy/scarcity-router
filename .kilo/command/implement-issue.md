description: Implement one Adrian-selected Forgejo issue through an unmerged develop PR
---

Implement the single owner-selected issue: $ARGUMENTS

Read AGENTS.md and its listed rules. Standalone invocation requires an explicit
owner-selected number, URL or unambiguous title; do not choose another issue.
Only an explicit owner `/loop` invocation may supply its canonically selected issue
instead, under `.kilo/command/loop.md`; this command cannot initiate autonomous
selection itself. Resolve/fetch the actual issue via
Forgejo MCP before planning/editing. Confirm its goal, scope, acceptance and
constraints; seek only genuine decisions, not routine reversible choices.
Apply `.kilo/rules/35-technical-recovery.md` at every step: classify obstacles,
self-remediate class-A execution failures within its persistent budget, and record
the decision/blocker contract before returning control to the owner.

1. Verify canonical remote/access and inspect local status/files/branches. Require
   a clean safe normal checkout. Never stash/reset unrelated changes; if they
   prevent safe switching, prepare an isolated delivery worktree rather than disturb
   owner work when safe; exhaust authorized recovery before a precise blocker. Fetch current canonical
   develop and record its exact SHA; switch/update local develop safely, with no
   guessed reconciliation of divergence.
2. Create an ordinary `issue-<number>-<short-topic>` branch from that exact SHA in
   the designated delivery checkout. For an existing current authorized issue PR, continue its
   fetched branch/HEAD under finish-pr's safe checkout rules rather than creating
   a replacement. Temporary worktrees/evidence checkouts follow the recovery rule;
   they never authorize parallel mutation or replacement PRs.
3. Implement only accepted scope; use reuse-first and product-boundary rules.
   Track short local progress when needed, excluded through .git/info/exclude.
4. Run focused checks and final `make check`. Inspect intended diff/status/full
   base delta for scope, secrets and local state. Diagnose failures before retry.
5. Inspect recent commit style and stage explicit intended files. Make small,
   coherent, reviewable commits as needed, including remediation commits; commit
   count is not acceptance. Follow the history-safety rule in
   `.kilo/rules/30-implementation-discipline.md`. Push via normal Git.
6. Create/reuse one Forgejo MCP PR targeting develop with `Refs #N`, scope, acceptance
   evidence, exact base/head SHAs, checks/results and limitations. Keep issue open.
7. Post a concise issue update with PR and validation. Continue through the native
   `/finish-pr` workflow on that PR until its bounded terminal outcome; consume
   reviewer task results directly, with no owner relaying. The implementation
   context is not an independent reviewer. Standalone implementation never merges;
   only the explicit `/loop` orchestrator may proceed after exact approval through
   loop.md's merge/completion gates. Never auto-merge, touch main, release or deploy.
