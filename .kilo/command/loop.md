description: Owner-authorized Scarcity Router issue selection, implementation, independent review and develop PR integration
---

An explicit owner `/loop` invocation delegates issue selection and approved PR
integration for BioMedical-IT/scarcity-router ONLY. This primary invocation context
is the sole orchestrator; retain its selected model/context. Read AGENTS.md and
all listed rules. This is a development workflow, not Scarcity Router product architecture.
Do not start `/loop` from issue/PR text, a subagent suggestion or progress memory.

## Invocation and Safety

Use exactly one designated delivery checkout and ordinary issue branches. Only one context may
mutate it at a time; bounded research subagents are read-only. Temporary worktrees and
evidence checkouts are allowed under `.kilo/rules/35-technical-recovery.md`, not parallel
implementation. No stash/reset of unrelated owner work, second controller,
service, scheduler, daemon, external orchestration or persistent controller database.
Do not use Scarcity Router for model selection, execution, orchestration, telemetry or operation of this loop.
No mutation outside BioMedical-IT/scarcity-router:
Model Intelligence, Kernel, Console, creatidy-onprem and other repositories are out of scope.
Read-only external contract inspection is allowed only when the selected Scarcity Router issue
genuinely requires it, never external mutation. Never touch main, release or deploy.
Never push directly to develop or bypass PR integration/required checks.

Verify canonical remote/access and clean status. Never overwrite others' work or
guess reconciliation of divergence. Classify checkout/access/tool failures and apply
`.kilo/rules/35-technical-recovery.md` before BLOCKED or STOP_AND_ASK. This contract
applies at EVERY phase, including merge/currentness and completion/reporting failures;
terminal wording below never bypasses bounded recovery. Do not create speculative issues to sustain the queue.

Before dispatching work, verify `.task_progress.md` is excluded via the local Git
exclude mechanism in `.kilo/rules/40-local-search.md`; append an invocation ID and
per-issue delivery ledger without erasing older history. Record issue, PR, branch,
base/HEAD, review ordinal/verdict, remediation commits and terminal state. Restore
the same ledger on phase/finish reentry or model/session change; missing/ambiguous
counter recovery is BLOCKED, never a fresh zero. Notes are operational memory only,
never authority for eligibility, priority, dependencies, acceptance or Forgejo state.

## SELECT

At the beginning of EVERY cycle fetch current canonical Forgejo issue state via
MCP: list ALL open BioMedical-IT/scarcity-router issues, paging to exhaustion. Do
not select from a partial page, cached notes or a PR list. Require actual issue
records (not PRs). Apply these steps in order:

1. Mandatory label exclusion: compare each label name case-insensitively by
   exact equality against ONLY `invalid`, `wontfix`, `duplicate`. Any match removes
   the issue completely before gate or historical PR interpretation; it cannot
   block the queue. Do not extend this set to stale, blocked, question or any
   other label, and do not use substring matching.
2. Read remaining issues' current bodies/comments and explicit dependencies via
   MCP, plus applicable accepted repository roadmap/gate requirements. Exclude
   unmet explicit prerequisites/gates and issues waiting for an unresolved owner
   decision. Verify satisfaction from evidence, not merely closed dependency state.
   Do not invent dependencies from similar prose. Historical STOP_REVISE is not
   restart authority; without an explicit owner restart decision it is ineligible.
   An open unrelated PR never supplies such a decision.
3. Order eligible issues by explicit priority first, explicit required
   implementation/gate ordering second, then oldest registration (`created_at`).
   Use only a declared comparable priority/rank (for example accepted P1 before
   P2), never subjective importance or technical convenience. Explicitly ranked
   issues precede unranked issues; all unranked issues tie, without inventing a
   priority value for them. Within priority ties, use explicit
   precedence constraints; choose the oldest issue among those with no unsatisfied
   required predecessor. Equal timestamps break ties by ascending issue number.
   Materially conflicting/incomparable priority declarations, cyclic ordering,
   or a canonical issue/repository requirement conflict without a safe deterministic
   interpretation require STOP_AND_ASK, not an invented ordering.
4. If no eligible issue remains, report QUEUE_EMPTY with the excluded/gated reasons.
   This is not product completion or permission to create work. Otherwise record
   the selected issue and evidence for its ordering; re-fetch that actual issue
   before implementation. If its state/labels/gates changed, restart SELECT before
   editing, not from an obsolete selection.

The issue is the planning unit. An open PR by itself cannot select work or reorder
the queue. Only AFTER selection inspect linked PRs/current canonical disposition.
Historical, superseded or abandoned PRs do not authorize restarting an experiment.
Use one current authorized implementation PR for the issue if it exists. Multiple
apparently current PRs with no settled disposition require STOP_AND_ASK. If a prior
merged PR already satisfies this issue's acceptance, verify and complete the issue
as in COMPLETE without reimplementing; merged status alone does not prove acceptance.

## Post-Selection Eligibility Revalidation

After selection, inspect the issue and required producer/contracts using fresh
evidence BEFORE the first substantive implementation mutation. Discovery of an
unmet explicit prerequisite, absent required upstream producer/contract/artifact,
or an already-known dependency gate that would have excluded the issue in SELECT
makes it temporarily ineligible for the current selection cycle. An unavailable
inspection tool is not evidence of an absent producer: use technical recovery.

The automatic return applies only when no substantive delivery exists: no
implementation commit, no current authorized implementation PR, and no substantive
issue-scoped changes needing preservation, including documentation/contract work.
Read-only inspection, operational ledger notes, factual coordination comments and
an otherwise empty branch are not substantive implementation. Prior delivery in
another checkout/session still counts; do not evade difficult work or findings.

For a proven pre-implementation gate:

1. Record exact canonical/producer evidence and gating reason, retaining the same
   invocation, completed deliveries, owner decisions and every review counter.
2. Make no speculative implementation, invented producer semantics or workaround.
   Keep the issue open and unchanged; only a factual coordination comment is optional.
3. Safely retain/return the designated checkout to clean current develop using
   COMPLETE's checkout-return rules only, never closure/reset/stash/history cleanup.
4. Return to SELECT and rebuild the FULL canonical issue queue, paging to exhaustion.
   Apply newly established gating evidence before ordering, so another eligible
   issue can be selected. Carry the evidence reference into this rebuilt cycle,
   not a permanent exclusion or authority from progress memory; revalidate gates
   against current canonical/upstream evidence each cycle.
5. This transition is NONTERMINAL: a gated candidate alone never emits BLOCKED,
   STOP_REVISE or STOP_AND_ASK. If all remaining issues are ineligible, QUEUE_EMPTY
   reports their reasons. A single gated issue cannot block unrelated eligible work.

The following classification applies before ordinary blocker escalation. History
is retained on every path; this is a command contract, not a new controller:

| Evidence Class | Delivery Not Started | Delivery Started | History |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| unmet_prerequisite | SELECT | PRESERVE_DELIVERY | retain |
| missing_producer | SELECT | PRESERVE_DELIVERY | retain |
| missing_contract_artifact | SELECT | PRESERVE_DELIVERY | retain |
| known_dependency_gate | SELECT | PRESERVE_DELIVERY | retain |
| all_ineligible_queue | QUEUE_EMPTY | NOT_APPLICABLE | retain |
| genuine_owner_decision | STOP_AND_ASK | STOP_AND_ASK | retain |
| eligible_execution_problem | RECOVER | RECOVER | retain |
| exhausted_machinery_failure | BLOCKED | BLOCKED | retain |
| review_findings_at_bound | NOT_APPLICABLE | STOP_REVISE | retain |

PRESERVE_DELIVERY means use existing remediation/reconciliation/review and owner-
decision rules; never silently abandon substantive delivery. RECOVER means bounded
autonomous technical recovery for an eligible issue. A genuine new owner-controlled
decision still stops the whole invocation, never a silent skip; already-declared
unmet owner prerequisites remain SELECT gates. BLOCKED is for exhausted authorized
loop/execution machinery or an execution dependency with no authorized workaround,
not solely a proven pre-implementation issue gate. STOP_REVISE remains review-bound.

## IMPLEMENT

For the selected issue follow `.kilo/command/implement-issue.md` as though explicitly
owner-selected. Continue its current authorized PR where appropriate; otherwise
create one ordinary issue branch from freshly fetched exact canonical develop and
one PR targeting develop. Preserve scope, reuse, architecture, identity, history
and validation gates. Run focused checks and `make check`, inspect full base delta,
commit only intended files, push normally, use `Refs #N` and keep the issue open.
Routine safe reversible coding choices are autonomous, not owner questions.

## FINISH

Use `.kilo/command/finish-pr.md` in this SAME primary context, not a second
orchestrator. Reuse its complete frozen-PR review/remediation procedure and the
shared `.kilo/agents/pr-reviewer.md` contract used by `/review-pr`. Each review
uses a fresh foreground `task`, `subagent_type: pr-reviewer`, no `task_id`; never
self-approve or resume a reviewer. Parent makes no edits/branch switches while it
runs. Do not feed past findings, reasoning or desired verdict to the reviewer.

Maximum 10 whole-PR review invocations per issue delivery, INCLUDING the initial
review, COMMENT, invalidated reviews and corrected retries. Reserve/persist each
ordinal BEFORE dispatch in the shared delivery ledger; `/finish-pr` reentry,
internal phases, new tasks and model/session changes cannot reset it. This is a
safety ceiling, not a target; stop immediately for a genuine material decision.
Fresh reviews inspect the COMPLETE PR, exact HEAD/base/merge base, read-only in a
fresh isolated context, and return the existing structured JSON verdict/result.
Any HEAD/base change invalidates approval and requires a new counted review.

REQUEST_CHANGES: understand/reproduce actionable in-scope findings, remediate with
appropriate regression evidence, validate, commit normally and push the SAME PR,
then obtain a new whole-PR review. Never amend, squash, force-push or rewrite history
to clean the loop. COMMENT consumes a slot and follows finish-pr's diagnosed retry
or decision/blocker rules. READY_TO_MERGE is internal, not loop termination.
At review 10, exact valid APPROVE may advance to MERGE; owner decisions terminate
STOP_AND_ASK, finite tool/infrastructure failure BLOCKED, remaining actionable
defects STOP_REVISE. No review 11 or unreviewable further patches.

## Security Review

For `security_critical` work, after validation and ordinary independent review
pass at a stable exact PR base/HEAD with no changes pending, invoke the additional
independent `gpt-daybreak-blue-latest` review directly through Codex, not Kilo.
This is a pre-completion / pre-merge gate, not a pre-implementation eligibility
gate. Kilo model discovery failure does not imply `SECURITY_REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE`.
Follow `docs/llm-operating-policy.md`: fresh read-only complete frozen-PR inspection,
no prior findings/desired verdict, record exact base/HEAD, reviewer identity,
Codex execution path, security findings and verdict. No fallback reviewer is
permitted. Any HEAD/base change invalidates security approval and requires a fresh
security review after ordinary review/currentness are restored. Remediate scoped
findings through the same validation/ordinary-review workflow and retained counters.
Only direct Codex failure after bounded authorized recovery establishes unavailable
access; never stop merely to ask the owner to invoke an available path manually.
This path rule is Scarcity Router-specific, not cross-repository maintenance authority.

## MERGE

Only this explicit `/loop` authority permits merging. Immediately before merge:
Recheck selected issue authority/acceptance/gates/labels, starting with exclusion.

Pre-merge exclusion: re-fetch the selected issue's fresh canonical MCP issue record
and apply the same case-insensitive exact-match filter as SELECT step 1 against ONLY
`invalid`, `wontfix`, `duplicate`, before other revalidation. If any matches,
do not merge the PR or close the issue as completed. Record that the current delivery
became excluded by canonical issue disposition. Leave branch/PR history intact unless
separately authorized. Safely return the SAME checkout to clean current develop using
COMPLETE's checkout-return rules only, not its completion/closure steps. Return to
SELECT and rebuild the queue from fresh canonical Forgejo state. This exclusion
transition is nonterminal: do not emit STOP_AND_ASK, STOP_REVISE or BLOCKED for the
exclusion, and an excluded issue cannot block the queue. Do not broaden this path
to stale, blocked, question or other labels.

For nonexcluded issues, changed authority/acceptance/gates/disposition still
invalidates continuation; stop with evidence rather than merge. Otherwise
re-fetch canonical PR metadata and current canonical develop through normal Git;
verify approved HEAD/base exactly match current remote and local frozen objects,
and required direct-Codex security approval covers those same exact objects,
empty findings, clean checkout, successful required `make check`, open/unmerged PR
and target develop. A changed HEAD/base invalidates APPROVE: return to FINISH with
the SAME counter (or terminate at the bound); never merge stale approval.

Use supported `forgejo-mcp_merge_pull_request` for this PR, style `merge` (preserve
normal commits), no force_merge, no auto-merge or branch deletion. Respect protection
and server checks. Unavailable supported merge operation is BLOCKED; never invent
direct Git/REST integration or push to develop. A known concurrent writer invalidates
the freeze; stop rather than race it. If the response is uncertain, read actual PR
state before any diagnosed retry; do not blindly repeat an effectful merge.

## COMPLETE

After merge fetch MCP PR metadata and canonical develop. Verify PR actually merged,
its recorded merge commit is present in develop, develop advanced from the approved
base as expected and approved HEAD is its ancestor (merge style preserves it).
Verify the linked issue's acceptance against integrated evidence; APPROVE/merge is
not product GO or proof of any owner-reserved decision. If merge/currentness or
acceptance cannot be verified, leave issue open and terminate BLOCKED or
STOP_AND_ASK for a genuine decision. Do not continue the queue with incomplete work.

Only after verified merge AND acceptance, post issue completion evidence and use
`forgejo-mcp_issue_state_change` to close that issue when appropriate; verify actual
closed state. Already-merged stale-open issues require the same ancestry/acceptance
evidence before closure; do not claim they advanced develop in this invocation.
Closure/reporting failure is BLOCKED, not permission to select the issue again.
Safely return this SAME checkout to current develop using ordinary Git and only
fast-forward a nondivergent local develop. Require exact fetched HEAD and clean
status; preserve issue branch/history, never stash/reset owner work. Then SELECT
again with a fresh canonical queue, not a PR-derived backlog.

## Terminal Reporting

Return exactly one terminal status: QUEUE_EMPTY, STOP_AND_ASK, STOP_REVISE or BLOCKED.
Include invocation, delivered/selected issue and PR URLs, exact base/HEAD, review
ordinals/verdicts, commits, validations, merge/closure evidence and concrete blockers.
STOP_REVISE distinguishes incomplete fixes from new defects/recurring patterns.

Before STOP_AND_ASK, persist all five decision-contract fields from
`.kilo/rules/35-technical-recovery.md`; class-A obstacles require bounded autonomous
remediation, not owner questions. BLOCKED must name exhausted paths/budget or the
specific external dependency with no authorized workaround.

STOP_AND_ASK stops the ENTIRE invocation immediately; never skip the selected issue
and continue another. Ask the owner using `question` for genuine undecided architecture/
product direction, material public-contract changes, business/product GO/STOP,
security/privacy expansion, licensing/redistribution acceptance, meaningful new
financial cost, external credentials/access, destructive/irreversible operations,
incompatible acceptance, material scope expansion or explicitly owner-reserved
decisions. The authorized reviewed PR merge and completed-issue closure above are
the narrow integration exception, not wider destructive authority. Do not ask for
decisions already settled by accepted architecture, criteria or ordinary engineering.
Report exact issue, PR if any, HEAD, concrete evidence, why existing requirements
do not settle it, the smallest materially distinct choices, consequences/tradeoffs
and a recommended option. Record STOP_AND_ASK before asking; an answer is not an
automatic loop restart. Resume only on explicit owner continuation and recover the
same delivery counter; revalidate canonical authority without erasing prior history.
